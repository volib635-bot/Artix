## Core Capabilities

### 📄 Document Forge
- **Multi-Format Technical Editor**: Rich editor powered by Monaco Editor supporting Markdown, XML, and Plain Text formats.
- **Split-Pane Live Preview**: Synchronized Markdown and XML rendering with high-contrast syntax highlighting.
- **Resilient Auto-Save Engine**: Debounced background persistence, multi-tab sync via BroadcastChannel, and optimistic lock queueing.
- **Multi-Format Export**: One-click export to PDF, standalone HTML, and raw Markdown.

### 📐 System Architect
- **Interactive Visual Canvas**: Drag-and-drop node graph canvas powered by React Flow.
- **Architectural Node Library**: Specialized nodes for Microservices, API Gateways, PostgreSQL Databases, Message Queues, and Cache layers.
- **Curved Connections & Freehand Drawing**: Custom edge routing and freehand sketch overlays for rapid whiteboarding.
- **Canvas Export**: High-resolution PNG, SVG, and structured JSON diagram export.

### 🧠 AI Intelligence Suite
- **PRD Generator**: Generates sprint-ready Product Requirements Documents across 4 specialized modes:
  - **Agile Mode**: Behaviorally complete user stories, Given/When/Then Definition of Done, and T-shirt sizing with complexity justifications.
  - **Technical Spec Mode**: Executable PostgreSQL schemas, fully typed API endpoint specs with HTTP status codes, edge cases, and security rules.
  - **Lean MVP Mode**: Riskiest hypothesis identification, explicit scope cuts, and falsifiable validation metrics.
  - **Custom Mode**: Strictly honors custom user instructions and structural preferences.
- **Vibe Coding Prompt Generator**: Generates surgical, file-precise prompts for Cursor, Artix, Bolt.new, v0, and generic AI coders with explicit file actions (`[NEW]`, `[MODIFY]`), exact function signatures, and post-change verification commands.
- **Agentic Workflow Designer**: Blueprints multi-agent systems across 6 architectural patterns (Sequential, Parallel Fan-Out, Orchestrator-Workers, Router, Evaluator-Optimizer, Autonomous ReAct).
- **Reflection & Refinement Pass**: Built-in 2-pass critique engine (`refine.ts`) that purges generic filler prose ("ensure scalability", "TBD") and expands technical specifications.

### 🔐 BYOK Security & Key Obfuscation
- **Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK)**: Supports OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, and local Ollama servers.
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Optional AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 passphrase derivation, paired with automated client-side key obfuscation to prevent plaintext exposure in local storage.

### ⚡ PWA & Offline Support
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable as a native desktop or mobile application.
- **Offline Workspace**: ServiceWorker precaching for uninterrupted document editing and offline system design.
